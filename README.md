# pandablocks_ioc

Create an IOC from a PandA

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install pandablocks-ioc`
Documentation   | <https://pandablocks.github.io/PandABlocks-ioc>
Releases        | <https://github.com/PandABlocks/PandABlocks-ioc/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from pandablocks_ioc import __version__

print(f"Hello pandablocks_ioc {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m pandablocks_ioc --version
```
