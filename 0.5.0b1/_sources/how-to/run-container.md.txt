# Run in a container

Pre-built containers with PandABlocks-ioc and its dependencies already
installed are available on [Github Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/PandABlocks/PandABlocks-ioc).

## Starting the container

To pull the container from github container registry and run:

```
$ docker run ghcr.io/pandablocks/PandABlocks-ioc:latest --version
